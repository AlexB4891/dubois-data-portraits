During the summer of 1895, in a Brooklyn park, there was a cotton
plantation complete with five hundred Black workers reenacting slavery.
The show was called "Black America, 1895"

27 Georgians were lynched 1899.  Between 1890 and 1900 Georgia averaged
more than one mob killing per month.

Black Lives did not matter.

In 1898 the duly elected people in Wilmington NC was violently
overthrown by whites.  The coup occurred after the state's white Southern
Democrats conspired and led a mob of 2,000 white men to overthrow the
legitimately-elected local Fusionist government.  They expelled opposition
black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property
and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including
the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more
than 300 people
